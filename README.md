## Download
You can download the class materials using the following command line:

	$ git clone https://github.com/wanirepo/advancedfmrianalysis_2019fall

Once you clone the github repository, you can just type the following command to get the updated github repository:

	$ git pull
	
Or you can download the repository as a zip file or you can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). The class materials will be uploaded (e.g., lecture slides, assignments) before each class. 

There is a good github tutorial: [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html)

## What are the aims of this course?

The functional neuroimaging, esp. functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has revolutionalized how we study human brain functions, human cognition, and behaviors. It enables us to study fine-grained neural dynamics and representations that give rise to adaptive human behaviors and cognitions. The powerful imaging methods and neuroimaging data had called for better analysis methods and approaches, and thanks to recent advances in statistical and computational methods (including machine learning), more researchers are developing and applying more advanced analysis methods to neuroimaging data. However, using more advanced methods itself does not make the study better automatically, and sometimes advanced methods make research worse by sacrificing the interpretability, robustness, and reproducibility of the research findings. These advanced methods should be used very carefully with a critical mind to actually help make research better. 

The idea of opening this class began with the 2019 OHBM meeting, where I saw a lot of advanced new analysis methods that I wasn't aware of, meaning that the field is rapidly changing (in terms of the analysis methodology), and we need to put efforts to know what kinds of analysis methods are being developed and used. We need to analyze them with critical eyes to know strengths and weaknesses of these new methods. Otherwise, we will stuck! Using them is one thing, but more importantly, we need to know the methods to understand the science behind the technology better and to know where the field is heading.  

Let's do this process together! I believe in a collective intelligence, and through the class, I hope we can do it together. 


## Course format and expectations

This class uses the flipped classroom format, which means that you will study the content in advance by watching video lectures related to the topic each week. We might not have video lectures for some weeks, and in that case, you will read one or two papers. 

We will make a list of the analysis methods we want to cover in the first class, and each student will be assigned to one method. The leader student should provide: 1) key papers that used the methods, 2) video lecture links (if available), 3) presentation in the class (focused on the method), 4) example data and codes (these will be uploaded to our class github repository). 

Before the class, all students are required to read each week's key papers and watch the video lectures (if there is any). In the class, the leader student has to give a presentation first, and also provides a hands-on experience.


## Evaluation

This class will use the absolute evaluation.

1. Attendance (30%)
2. Presentation/hands-on (40%)
5. Participation (30%)
